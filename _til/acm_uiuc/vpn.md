Certain online resources are only available when you are connected 
to the university network. Luckily, they offer a VPN service 
(https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn) 
that allows you to access the resources remotely. The VPN is NOT for 
remotely connecting to engineering workstation computers to run their software. 
If you wish to do that, check out some of the solutions described on 
https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections. 
The VPN + a remote connection solution should allow you to get most of your
work done remotely rather than in the lab (especially if you use a Mac or Linux).
