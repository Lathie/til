## Best Type of Bike
The best type of bike is a cheap bike. You will not being treating your
bike well, leaving it outside in the rain and snow, so don't bring your 
carbon racing bike or your full suspension bike (though there are some good
Mountian Biking Trails in the area [https://www.kickapoombc.org/map.pl](https://www.kickapoombc.org/map.pl))
Many people choose cheap single speed bikes, which is a good choice in 
CU since there is virtually no elevation gain. 

## Bike Requirements
If you decide to bring a bike, don't forget the accessories. 
You will want to bring a bike lock (or locks) so that you 
can securely lock up your bike (both wheels and the frame). 
Try to buy a U-Lock, while Chambana is relatively safe, bike 
theft is frequent and typically a cable lock does not put up much of a fight (I/Naren learned this the hard way).  
If you are planning on riding after dusk, you will need a 
bike light (ideally a front and rear light). An air pump and 
bike wrenches are not completely necessary. There are numerous 
bike repair stations located around campus, near most dorms.
These are free self-service stations that have all of the tools 
you will need for making adjustments to your bike or pumping up your tires. 
Finally, don't forget your helmet!

## Fix your Bike
There is also the Campus Bike Center and the Urbana Bike 
Project which are places to get more involved help and get access to more esoteric tools.
