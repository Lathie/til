There are times when you will need an unofficial transcript of all of your grades and courses. 
You also might want to verify that you are on track to meet all of the graduation requirements 
for your degree on time. Luckily, you can generate a DARS audit (http://registrar.illinois.edu/dars/generate.html) 
to accomplish both of these tasks. This audit will show all courses you have ever taken at Illinois
along with your grade in the course. It will also show any graduation requirements that you still 
need to meet. I would recommend checking the audit at least once a semester. One other useful feature 
that it offers is the ability to add a __What If Course__, This is a course you are considering taking. 
When you add it as a what if course, the audit will factor it in and show you how it will affect things 
like your GPA and remaining graduation requirements. The other option for unofficial transcripts is to 
log into Enterprise (https://eas.admin.uillinois.edu/eas/servlet/EasLogin) and go to 
Registration & Records → Student Records and Transcripts → View Academic History. Finally, 
remember that this is all unofficial. You should always confirm with an adviser when unsure 
about whether a course will fulfill a graduation requirement.
