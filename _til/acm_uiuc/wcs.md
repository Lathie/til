Women in Computer Science (WCS) is a great resource for any women here 
(and men who might are interested to support). They organize many 
networking events for their members and bring in companies on a regular 
basis to give talks (and bring dinner). During the day, their officers 
hold office hours where you can stop by to chat, get help with your work,  
or take a mock interview. In addition to all of this, they also organize many 
social events for members to hang out and have fun.
