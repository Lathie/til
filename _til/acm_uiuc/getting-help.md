There are many resources available to your for help in your classes. At the start of this series, we mentioned Piazza as an online Q&A Board for some of your help. Beyond that, we also have numerous people available to help you. First you have the Undergraduate Course Assistants who took the course recently and therefore are closest to the material. Then we have the Graduate Teaching Assistants who help write the course and often grade your homework or your exams. Next,  you have the Professor who teaches the course. Each of these people have office hours where you can ask for help with assignments or exam preparations. Definitely use these opportunities. Furthermore, there are often people available to help you in ACM or WCS or any other RSOs you are part of. Finally, there are tutors available for a lot of engineering classes in the CARE tutoring at Grainger Engineer Library.
