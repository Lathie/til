There are always events going on around campus. Luckily, they are all 
listed on calendars to make it easy to see what is happening. 
http://illinois.edu/calendar/list/7 has links to many of these calendars.
Some worth noting include the academic calendar (http://illinois.edu/calendar/list/557), 
the CS department calendar (http://illinois.edu/calendar/list/2654), and ACM's calendar 
(https://acm.illinois.edu/). Lastly, Facebook groups like ACM and Computer Science 
generally have a lot of events thrown onto them. I would highly recommend that you 
subscribe to these calendars to stay up-to-date on what is going on around you.
