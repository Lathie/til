Exams work a bit differently at Illinois than in high school. 
In most cases (especially for your larger classes), exams will 
take place in the evening rather than during your regular class 
time. The class will be distributed among several different lecture 
halls across campus to allow everyone taking the class to complete 
the exam at the same time. In the event that you are not able to 
take the exam at this time for a valid reason, the professor will 
allow you to take a conflict exam. A conflict exam is an exam that 
covers the same material and is of the same difficulty as the regular
exam. The only difference is that the questions are different. This 
is so students do not simply get all of the questions/answers from 
friends who already took the regular exam. If you are sick and need 
to take a conflict exam, make sure to visit the medical facility at 
McKinley to get a doctors note (I donâ€™t think the university accepts 
notes from external hospitals except in special circumstances).
