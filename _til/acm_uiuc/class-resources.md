Classes will use a variety of websites to manage materials including [Compass](https://compass2g.illinois.edu/), [Moodle](https://learn.illinois.edu/auth/shibboleth/gateway.php), [Chara](https://chara.cs.illinois.edu/), and [Relate](https://relate.cs.illinois.edu/) for posting grades throughout the semester. This can be very useful for ensuring you are on track to receive your desired grade both before and after an exam. These websites is also used for distributing/collecting certain homework assignments and for taking online quizzes. The sites are not that difficult to use, but it is worth taking a few minutes to sit down and play around with the ones you can access. You don't want to be scrambling to figure out how to submit an assignment at 11:59pm for a midnight due date. More importantly, manage your time and donâ€™t submit assignments right before they are due! (often the tools used to collect assignments slow down or crash right when they are due).
