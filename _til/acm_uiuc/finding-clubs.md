Clubs at UIUC are refered to as Registered Student Organizations (RSOs)

## Quad Day and E-Night
At the start of the school year, there will be two events designed 
to get new students involved in RSOs on campus. 
The first one is Quad Day, which typically takes place on the first Sunday of the semester. 
During Quad Day, most clubs at Illinois will have booths set up on the main quad. 
You will be able to go from club to club to talk to their officers, get more information 
(and lots of free giveaways), and sign up for their mailing list. 
The second event is E-Night. This is similar to Quad Day, but only for Engineering clubs.

I would strongly encourage you guys to attend both of these events and get involved with a few
clubs. Putting your name down on a clipboard at one of these events does not obligate you to 
join the group; it just ensures that you will receive information about their meetings and 
how to get involved. However, joining a group is a great way to meet new people and have 
fun outside of class. Also, take a look at the RSO list before going so that you have an 
idea of what organizations you might want to talk to (thereâ€™s a [full list of RSOs](https://illinois.collegiatelink.net/organizations) but you will need a UIUC 
email and password to log-in)
