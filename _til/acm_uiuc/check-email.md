title: Check You Email

Get in the habit of checking your email often. 
Email is the main way that you will receive 
important, often time-sensitive, announcements 
from faculty and staff. These emails will go to 
your @illinois.edu address, not your personal email. 
Likewise, you should use your school address for 
sending emails to faculty and staff. It is important 
that you either setup your school address to forward 
all emails to an account you actually check or to start 
checking your school email account frequently. Details 
on how to enable forwarding are available at https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957.
