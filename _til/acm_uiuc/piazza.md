Most of your CS classes will use an online Q&A system called Piazza. 
The system allows you to ask a question and receive answers from other 
students in the class as well as TAs and professors. It also allows 
course staff to make announcements to everyone in the class. I would 
strongly recommend taking the time to read all of the questions and 
answers that get posted. Even if a problem does not pertain to you, 
it is still possible to learn something new from it (or from one of 
the solutions). Helping to answer questions is also a great way to 
reinforce material you have learned, study, and help your peers. 
Furthermore, sometimes questions will serve as clarifications about
assignments and will be used as the final guidelines on how to complete homework.

More immediately, the CS and ECE Departments have created a Piazza pages 
specifically for answering your questions here: 

- [CS Advising](https://piazza.com/class/i69uo2ijxwm4ql) 
- [ECE Advising](https://piazza.com/class/ikbpc6y3ui61u6). 

To create a Piazza account, you need to have a university email address.
