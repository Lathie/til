title: Getting Around Campus

Parking around campus is not cheap. Unless you have a friend living in an apartment who will 
allow you to park in one of their spots, you will probably end up paying quite a bit of
money for a permit to park in one of the university lots. Parking outside of academic
buildings is also either by permit or meter. Unless you are going to be driving up to 
Chicago every weekend (or something similar), I would probably recommend leaving the 
car at home. 

## Busses
Illinois has a great bus system that is free for students. The 22 Illini 
bus goes all over campus and runs every 10 minutes. There are also buses that go to 
downtown Champaign, downtown Urbana, and the mall and airport. If you end up living 
in PAR or FAR, your primary busses will be the 12, 13, 21, and 22. If you live in ISR 
or Busey, your primary busses will be the 10, 12, and 22. If you live in Ikenberry, your 
primary busses will be the 1, 10, and 22. Feel free to look up their routes at https://www.cumtd.com/.
I would also highly recommend downloading one of the numerous CUMTD bus apps before coming to 
campus to use (I use the iOS app called “CU Transit”). 

## Get A Bike
If you want an even faster way to get around campus, I would suggest looking into a bicycle; 
Champaign-Urbana is very bike friendly.  

## Getting To and From Campus
Finally, for getting to/from campus, there are several bus companies, primarily Peoria Charter 
and Suburban Express (don't take Suburban Express if you can avoid it) that offer fairly reasonable prices 
to/from the Chicagoland area. There is also the Amtrak and Willard Airport.
