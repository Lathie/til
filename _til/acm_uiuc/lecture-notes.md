In your large lectures, focus on listening and understanding 
what the professor is saying rather than writing down everything 
they say/put on the screen. Most classes publish lecture notes and 
make video recordings of the lecture available online, which you 
can use to study from. This isn't to say you should not take notes, 
but active listening will prove extremely beneficial when doing 
homework or studying for an exam.
