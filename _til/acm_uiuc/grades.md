You have probably heard that most of your classes will be graded on a bell curve. 
By the nature of such a curve, you are competing against the other people in the 
class since only a certain number of people can get an A, B, C, etc. While you will 
definitely have a couple of classes like this, from my experience, it is not the norm. 
Instead, most professors will announce on day one the breakdown of grades. They will 
tell you what percentage of your final grade will come from homework, tests, the final 
exam, etc. They will then record your grade on each of these assignments as a point value 
rather than a letter. At the end of the semester, they will tally everything up to get 
your final letter grade. It is at this point that the professor might make adjustments. 
Keep in mind, each professor can make their own policies on how to handle grades, so 
pay attention to your syllabus. Since most classes aren't graded on bell curves, one of 
the best aspects of UIUC is that students don’t compete with each other, they work together. 
Find a group of people who have a similar work ethic, and try to tackle assignments together 
(because in the “real world” you almost surely won’t be alone at work). Also, don’t stress a 
ton about grades. The academic goal of college is to learn what you need to know for the rest 
of your life, not to attain a grade, and especially in CS, grades are often not considered 
(no company has ever asked me for my GPA). Focus on the material, and you’ll do well enough 
in the classes (don’t memorize code, learn to solve problems).
