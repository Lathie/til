title: Get Hardware Fast

Amazon is great for most things, but there are times when 2 
day delivery is simply not fast enough. Luckily, we have the 
ECE Supply Center (http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/shop/). 
This store has most cables and hardware you will need for your 
computer or projects. The convenient location (yes, you need to 
go to an actual store) and cheap prices make it a great resource for last minute purchases.
