Most of your work will be submitted electronically. However, there 
will be times where you need to print documents/assignments. As an 
engineering student, you will get 300 pages of printing per semester 
to use at the various College of Engineering labs. There are also 
computer labs available in most major academic buildings for students 
to use (you will need to pay a nominal fee to print at most of these). 
Most of the dorms also have computer labs with printing available in them. 
Finally, many roommates will decide to bring one printer to share between them.
I personally don't do much printing, and I go through well under a ream of 
paper per year. I donâ€™t see much of a use to buying your own printer. When 
I do have to print, I print at either the ACM office (free for members), or at the computer labs.
