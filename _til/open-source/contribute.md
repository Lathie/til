# Get Involved
Also look to get involved in Open Source, there are plenty of projects out there that need help and you use many of them every day (Firefox, Android, Chrome, Linux, Brew). 
Projects need help doing everything from commenting code to making websites to just answering people’s questions. And its possible to work in person with these groups at 
Illinois as there are a couple projects based out of NCSA and professors labs (Bro, LLVM, Clang, JS).  It’s a great way to learn to develop stable code with many other people, and is a huge plus for companies when hiring.
