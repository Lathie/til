title: Publishing Code
category: open source
---

As you start to do more programming (both in and out of class), you should consider making them available publicly online via a site like https://github.com/ . This makes it easy for you to accept contributions to your code from other people. It also allows you to show off your projects to companies. Don't be embarrassed if you think the code is not perfect. Your futureprojects will be better, and companies like to see the increase in code quality as you learn more in your classes. 

The one catch: 

make sure to check with a Professor before posting code for a class assignment as someone may end up copying your code if the assignments aren't changed.

## PUT A LICENSE ON IT 
It pretty important you put a license on a project which you want to release publically.While we are layers and this does not consistute legal advice, code without a license on it 
even if publically readable, is still copyright of the author. If you want people to use you code and work on it consider putting an open source license on you code. [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)
is a good resource to choose a license, but may I recommend the [UIUC/NCSA License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ncsa/).It is the prefered license of ACM and a good premissive open source license in the vein of BSD-3 Clause. 

#Get Involved
Also look to get involved in Open Source, there are plenty of projects out there that need help and you use many of them every day (Firefox, Android, Chrome, Linux, Brew). 
Projects need help doing everything from commenting code to making websites to just answering people’s questions. And its possible to work in person with these groups at 
Illinois as there are a couple projects based out of NCSA and professors labs (Bro, LLVM, Clang, JS).  It’s a great way to learn to develop stable code with many other people, and is a huge plus for companies when hiring.
