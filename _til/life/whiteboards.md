Get comfortable working out problems on a dry erase board 
(I would also recommend purchasing a small one for your room).
Not only are they great for group collaboration, but they 
also work exceptionally well for theory CS classes and math 
problems. While you can technically solve these problems on 
paper or a computer, being able to visualize everything at 
once and easily change parts is very helpful. Most importantly, 
many companies will also have you solve programming interview
problems on a dry erase board, so practicing this skill with 
homework problems will prove beneficial. You can also spend
some time working in conference rooms in Siebel (the cs building) 
or Grainger Engineering Library where they have whiteboards to use.
