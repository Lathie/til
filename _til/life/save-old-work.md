title: Save Old Work
category: life

Archive, don't delete. If you aren't already, get in the habit of saving everything. 
Save all your emails, homework assignments, old quizzes/exams, etc. There have been 
countless incidents where I find myself working on a problem similar to one I 
solved in the past. Rather than attempting to either remember how I previously 
solved it or trying to re-solve it from scratch, I have been able to simply pull 
up my old solution. In the case of email, being able to reference old conversations 
can be helpful when trying to remember what decision was made and the rationale 
behind it. Storage is cheap, your time is valuable.
For what it is worth, most of your classes follow this philosophy as well. They 
usually keep old homework assignments and exams available on their websites. If you 
already took a class, you can even pull up your old homework submissions from the 
class's subversion repository.
