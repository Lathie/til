The importance of exercise is often stated, but rarely acted upon. As an engineer, you may spend your freshman year walking a lot (the dorms are fairly far from the CS building). However, as you enter apartments in your next years and you become busier with your computer science curriculum, you will find yourself spending most of the day on your laptop. Therefore, I would recommend finding a way to get into a rhythm that includes exercise while you are still getting used to the university. We have excellent exercise facilities at the ARC and CRCE as well as a large campus that is very conducive to both biking and walking. This will help keep you energized that can improve concentration, as well as keeping your physically fit.
