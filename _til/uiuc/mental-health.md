While most people realize the importance of good physical health (we have great exercise facilities at some dorms and at the ARC and CRCE) , some forget that mental health is just as important. Sometimes, talking through problems with a friend or family member is sufficient, but if you find you need professional help, the university does offer a couple of resources. First, there is the [Counseling Center](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/). They offer free same day counseling services to students. In the event that ongoing support is required, they will either provide the resources directly or help refer you to another resource in the community. The [McKinley Health Center Mental Health Clinic](http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/clinics/mental_health.htm) also provides some resources such as short-term psychotherapy and medication treatment as needed. While you need an appointment for both of these places, tell them if you have an urgent emergency situation. They will fit you in. They have also both partnered with the Champaign County Mental Health Center Crisis Line to ensure they can provide emergency services 24/7.
These resources are provided to help students. If you feel that they might benefit you in any way, I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment. Everything is kept confidential, and you have nothing to lose, but a lot to gain.
