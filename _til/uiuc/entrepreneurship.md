Many of the questions we get are often about whether there are any opportunities
to get involved in the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial spirit. We have several programs
and events put on by the [Technology Entrepreneurship Center](http://tec.illinois.edu/). 
These include classes, certifications, trips to entrepreneurial hubs, and events to connect
founders and provide opportunities to pitch your ideas. Furthermore, we have RSOs like 
Founders who puts on the equivalent of an entrepreneurship hackathon: 54.io. Finally, 
we have the [iVenture Accelerator](https://business.illinois.edu/iventureaccelerator/) 
and the [EnterpriseWorks Incubator](http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/enterpriseworks).
