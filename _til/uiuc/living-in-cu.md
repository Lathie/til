Cornfield jokes aside, there are bunch of institutions in the community 
that people love to frequent. 

## Restaurants
For food on campus there is a pretty wide variety. Near Green Street 
people love to go to Mashawi Grill for Mediterranean, Pho Cafe and Bangkok Thai 
for some Thai, and Maize for some Mexican. There is Ambar for some Indian and 
the legendary Cravings for some Chinese. 

As you move off campus more, you will find some really nice fine dining places, 
including Radio Maria, Bacaro and V Picasso. For special occasions most 
people will go to Black Dog, which serves some amazing BBQ.

## Coffee
Coffee is also a huge thing in Champaign-Urbana, locations like Flying Machine,
Kopi, Paradiso and Aroma being favorites. Each has its own style and typical 
clientele, so its easy to find a place to get some work done.

## Groceries 
There is one major Super Market on campus called County Market. Most of what you need 
you will find there. 

If you are looking for Organic Groceries or something closer to Whole Foods, there is a 
food co-op in Urbana called Common Ground. 

## Music and Art
There are some great places on Campus and in town to listen to Music and check out some Art.

Canopy Club is a concert venue just south of Green Street which serves as a pit stop for many headliner
acts (Louis the Child, Madeon, and more)

Krannert Center for the Performing Arts has a large variety of concerts and shows.

Cowboy Monkey in Downtown Champaign also puts on more local acts. 

There are also art galleries in Downtown Champaign and Downtown Urbana that will put on showings 

## Makerspaces

There are a bunch of places to make things.
Urbana has a makerspace in the basement of IMC in downtown Urbana, the Business School hosts one in their building. 
There is also the Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab on the south quad, the ECE Department has the Open Lab in ECEB
and ACM has its own in the back room of the ACM office 

## Fix your Bike
There is are bike stations accross campus to pump up your tires and get access to common tools. 
There is also the campus bike center and the Urbana Bike Project which are places to get more involved help and get access to more esoteric tools. 

## Shopping
On campus, there aren’t a lot of retail stores yet. Urban Outfitters on Green street
is the only major clothing/retail store. Cheaper clothing can be found at Ragstock - 
especially if you’re looking for a last minute sweater or a Halloween costume. If 
you are looking to get a winter coat, Champaign Surplus is probably the closest 
place that you will be able to find one. We also have a mall that you can get to 
via a free bus from campus. The mall has plenty of big name stores, so you can 
probably find anything you need there.


I would recommend getting off campus and exploring the area. There are plenty of 
weird and interesting places:record shops, comic book stores and more.
