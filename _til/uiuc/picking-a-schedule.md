title: Picking a Schedule

Creating the perfect class schedule can be a challenge. First, you need to 
ensure you are taking all of the necessary classes. Then, you need to find 
sections that fit together without overlapping, finally, you can try to 
make it more perfect by tweaking the time you start/end class each day, 
what days of the week you have classes, and how long of a lunch you have (to 
name a few tweaks). For your first semester, one suggestion I would give is 
to take CS 125 (intro to CS) and CS 173 (discrete math) together. Even coming 
in with no computer science experience, both of these classes give you a good
ramp up. However, that being said, it is important to also consider what other
classes are being taken with that. Therefore, in regards to choosing classes, 
I highly recommend speaking with a couple different upperclassmen to hear their
perspectives. A class isnâ€™t always what it seems to be on the syllabus, and many
upperclassmen will know which professors are more conducive to what kinds of learning.
