#Dorm Shipping
Dorms have mail desks that will recieve and hold your package/mail for you. You just need your I-Card to recover it. 

Don't forget to update your mailing/shipping address. Most of you have probably been using your home address when registering for various sites/services. If you plan on using any of those services while at college, make sure you update you address to be your dorm address. Otherwise, you will not be seeing those letters/packages until Thanksgiving. Some services that you will probably want to update include things like Amazon, election ballots, and the bank. You should also make sure your family and friends know your address (they might even surprise you by sending a gift for a special occasion). You can also alert the postal service that you have moved and have them help forward your mail (https://www.usps.com/manage/forward-mail.htm).
