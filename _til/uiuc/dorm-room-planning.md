When you are planning out the layout for your dorm room, 
make sure you leave room for guests. At some point or another, 
you will want to have friends over to study, play games, or party. 
Everyone understands that dorm rooms aren't the largest, but 
leaving an open area where everyone can hang out and having 
some extra seats can affect whether your room becomes the "social" 
room where everyone wants to hang out or not. Something like http:

an be good for the dual purpose of storage and an extra seat. All dorms 
also have study lounges (which can be used for fun activities if nobody 
is studying there). Make sure to get to know your special facilities 
when you first move in (find laundry facilities, Allen/Weston/ISR/Nugent/etc.
have useful basements, etc.) or refer to the floor plans available online. 
Getting a microwave/fridge can be very helpful if you want to work in your
dorm and need a late night snack after the cafeterias are closed (the 
latest facilities close at midnight and open at 8 AM).
