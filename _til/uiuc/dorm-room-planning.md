When you are planning out the layout for your dorm room, 
make sure you leave room for guests. At some point or another, 
you will want to have friends over to study, play games, or party. 
Everyone understands that dorm rooms aren't the largest, but 
leaving an open area where everyone can hang out and having 
some extra seats can affect whether your room becomes the "social" 
room where everyone wants to hang out or not. Something like http:

also have study lounges (which can be used for fun activities if nobody 
is studying there). Make sure to get to know your special facilities 
when you first move in (find laundry facilities, Allen/Weston/ISR/Nugent/etc.
have useful basements, etc.) or refer to the floor plans available online. 
Getting a microwave/fridge can be very helpful if you want to work in your
dorm and need a late night snack after the cafeterias are closed (the 
latest facilities close at midnight and open at 8 AM).

## Meeting you Roommate

Take some time to get to know your roommate. Where are they from? What is their major? What courses are they taking? What are their hobbies? Try and eat a few meals per week with them or go to some other events together. It isn't essential that you become best friends, but being friendly with each other will make your first year a lot more enjoyable. Your roommate can also be very helpful when trying to meet new people (it is pretty easy for you to introduce your roommate to your friends and for them to introduce you to their friends). Furthermore, if you and your roommate really get along well, you might even consider living with them again next year (I recommend waiting a couple months before starting roommate hunting). Finally, your RA will most likely put on many events for you. Definitely get involved in these and get to meet the other members of your floor.
