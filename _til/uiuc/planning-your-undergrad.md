title: Plan Your Undergrad
category: uiuc
---

Take some time to plan out your schedule for each semester between now and when you 
graduate. It is ok to have some gaps in the schedule, but having a rough timeline 
will help make sure you leave room for all of the classes you want to take and that 
you can graduate on time. It will also make your life easier at the end of the 
semester when you go to register for classes. A lot of the information about 
courses is available here:[Undergrad CS Curriculum](https://cs.illinois.edu/current-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-curriculum-requirements) 
[Undergrad ECE Curriculum](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/curriculum/) 
Not all of it is up to date, so I would highly recommend talking to an adviser 
with more specific questions. I would also suggest building out your 4 year course plan 
to include general education requirements, minors you are interested in, and any study 
abroad plans to ensure that you can make your college experience as positive as possible. 
Once you have this built, it can help to show it to an upperclassmen as a sanity check to 
ensure you arenâ€™t taking multiple extremely difficult classes at once.
