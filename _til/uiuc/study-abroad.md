Studying abroad is an opportunity that many Engineering students donâ€™t end up having the opportunity to experience because of the rigorous course load. However, with proper planning, many destinations are open to you as well. If you want to take primarily general requirements (history, math, science, etc.) then you can take those in most places; however, if you are primarily looking at taking cs abroad, look for programs like Sweden where this is an option. If you want to spend a semester abroad, there is a limited number of courses you can take, so definitely talk to a counselor or upperclassmen who has this experience to determine what makes the most sense for you. If studying abroad during the semester seems like too much, there are also a limited number of summer and winter study abroad programs. Keep an eye on your Illinois emails as most of these opportunities will be sent to you during the year.
