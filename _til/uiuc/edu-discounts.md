In case you did not know, many websites and stores offer discounts to college 
students if you use a .edu email address (you have 2: netid@illinois.edu and netid@uiuc.edu) 
or show your student id. There are too many to list, but [Amazon Prime](www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info) 
is probably the best known (and quite useful). Another service that is useful for CS majors that offers 
a college discount is [GitHub](https://education.github.com/). GitHub has even put together an awesome 
pack of free software (https://education.github.com/pack) containing everything you need to turn your 
next project idea into reality without spending a dime. Also, local movie theaters give discounts if 
you show your id. In short, before you make any purchases, I would take the extra minute to 
search and see if you can get a discount.
