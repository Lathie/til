Sooner or later, you will need to contact another student or 
professor without having their email address. Luckily, the 
university has a public searchable directory of all students, 
faculty, and staff at http://illinois.edu/ds/search . You can 
search by name, NetID, or a few other criteria. You can even 
include wildcards. This tool is also useful if you ever need 
to convert a name to a NetID or vice-versa.
If you have access to ssh, you can ssh into ews and use nph, a 
command line phone book. When connected to ews type ```nph [name of student]``` 
and you will get back people who match your search term
