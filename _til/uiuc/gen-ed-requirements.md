Alongside your required classes, you will also be expected to take several general 
education requirements. These courses are an excellent opportunity for you to explore
an area you are interested in or donâ€™t know anything about. Many of you may not have 
liked literature or history (hence not being a humanities major); however, these 
classes have the ability to both widen your own knowledge and give you a break from all
the math/science/coding in your day (as well as often serve as a GPA booster). Whether 
you are interested in philosophy or psychology, mythology or videography, I am sure you 
can find a course that interests you. You can use this website to browse classes by the 
requirements they fill: https://courses.illinois.edu/gened/DEFAULT/DEFAULT. You can also 
join this Facebook group for more information on easy classes:

eds based on the material, not just the gpa averages.
