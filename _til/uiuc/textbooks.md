I would recommend waiting until after you receive the syllabus for each of your classes to buy any books. Book requirements change from semester to semester. Waiting for the syllabus ensures you know the actual requirements. As for acquiring the books, there are two book stores on campus: the Illini Union Bookstore and TIS. Depending on the class, your book will usually be available in at least one of these locations. Be aware that they will have extremely long lines (plan for half an hour) the first week or two of the semester. These stores will allow you to purchase new or used books. In addition to these physical stores, many of your books can also be found online on sites like Amazon (you can even get 6 months of free Prime as a student:www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info). Some other options you have for getting books include the [Illini Book Exchange](http://www.illinibookexchange.com/), which allows you to buy books directly from other students (often for a lower price) and renting your books for a semester. There is also a FB group for this: https://www.facebook.com/groups/210775709031423/. 

## Resell Your Books 
It is important to keep in mind that you will probably want to get rid of your textbooks after the semester is over. The better the condition of the book,the more money you will be able to sell it back for. Renting a book has the
distinct advantage that you do not need to find a buyer for your book. Finally, do some research and try and determine whether the author is about to release a new edition of the book. This is fairly common, and it causes the resale value of your book to drop significantly.I usually like to compare prices between the physical stores and Amazon, 
and then order a new copy of the book from the cheaper store. Buying new ensures that I know exactly what I am receiving. It also provides me with the most flexibility when the semester is over and I am trying to sell the book.
Furthermore, you should also be aware that most of your required books will be available at the library on reserve. This means that you can reference them whenever you want, but you are not allowed to check them out. This can 
be useful if there is a required book that you know you will only need for one small assignment. Finally, many of your CS classes will have a free online textbook or lecture notes, so definitely consider that as an option 
if you donâ€™t feel the need for a physical book (I have never bought a book for a CS class).
