title: Stuff is Down

When you experience a problem with one of the university's many services, 
it can be useful to know if it is a known/planned downtime or if it is a 
new issue that should be reported. http://status.illinois.edu/ 
(and https://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ for some issues) is a great place 
to start. Known issues will be noted on that site. In the event that the
issue is not listed there, you should be sure to report it. If they do 
not know an issue exists, they cannot work to fix it.
