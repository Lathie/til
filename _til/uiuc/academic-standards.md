As a student of the university, you are held to certain [academic standards](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3_part1_3-110.html). If you have a 
bad semester and fail to meet these standards, you will usually be placed 
on academic probation. If you are placed on academic probation, you will 
be given [certain conditions](https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ugadvise/Probation+and+Drop+(Rules)) 
to meet in order to get off of probation. Usually, this will simply involve getting 
better grades the next semester and raising your GPA. If you meet your probation 
requirements, everything is good. However, failure to meet the requirements may result 
in you being dropped from the university.
