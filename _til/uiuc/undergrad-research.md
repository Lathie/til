They all had very positive experiences with it. One way to get involved with 
research is through PURE (https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/PURE/Information). 
This is a program designed specifically to help get underclassmen involved with research. 
They even put on a small symposium at the end to allow the students to show off what 
they have worked on. The second common approach to getting involved with research is 
by simply talking with your professors. Most professors are involved with research 
in some way shape or form. Find a professor doing research in an area that interests 
you and ask them about getting involved. Worst case scenario, they say no. But it is 
more likely that they will be happy to have you helping out and getting involved.
From what I have seen, there are more research opportunities than there are students 
interested in doing research. So while you might not necessarily get to work on your first 
choice project, you should not have too much trouble finding a research opportunity if 
you are persistent and don't give up.

In addition to opportunities within the Computer Science department, the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) offers a special program, Students 
Pushing Innovation (SPIN: http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/), that allows undergraduate 
students to get involved in technical projects under a mentor as well. The building is 
located right across from Siebel Center. NCSA holds a special open house in the Fall 
that allows prospective students to talk with the mentors who are seeking undergraduate
students for their projects/research. After you apply, interested professors will 
reach out to you for an interview. One of the benefits that the SPIN program offers
is that itâ€™s a paid internship whereas Undergraduate Research might not all the time.
