You are going to have quite a few different passwords throughout your 
time at Illinois. Your primary university password can be changed here: 
[UIUC Password Change](https://identity.uillinois.edu/iamFrontEnd/iam/start/?campus=uiuc). Some of 
your passwords will also have expiration dates attached to them, forcing 
you to change them periodically. You can look into either using a password 
manager like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) 
or coming up with an easy to remember password system that is secure.

Once you have a secure password, an easy way to handle the password expirations is 
to incorporate the semester or year into the password.
