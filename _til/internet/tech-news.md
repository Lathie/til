You will learn a lot of information in your classes and from your peers. 
However, if you want to be successful as a computer scientist, you need to 
be reading and staying up-to-date on new things going on in the field. 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), some of the many computer-related 
subreddits on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/), 
etc. are just a few sites that you might find helpful. The information you learn from
these sites can serve as inspiration for personal projects, introduce you to new 
technologies, and ensure that you can carry on an intelligent conversation with other
people you might meet. I personally also use a morning news digest started by a UIUC
alum that gives a summary of relevant news called the [Daily Water Cooler](www.dailywatercooler.com/?ref=626e891c6a)
supplemented by the [Morning Brew](http://www.morningbrewdaily.com/?kid=A0V34).
For more research oriented coverage check out [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) which covers a computing paper a day.
