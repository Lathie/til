If you are interested in trying to find a summer internship, 
there is no shortage of opportunities. The university, 
college of engineering, CS department, and ACM all hold 
job fairs designed to help you learn about different 
companies and find a job. Engineering 100 will have you 
create a resume as one of your assignments. I strongly 
encourage you to put some thought and effort into it, as it 
will prove very useful throughout your time in college (and a
fter you graduate). Also, be sure to actually attend the job 
fairs. While finding an internship as a freshman can be 
challenging (although, definitely not impossible; especially
if you are entering with some prior experience in programming), 
the skills and experience you gain talking with recruiters/engineers a
nd solving interview-style problems will help you in the future. I 
highly recommend going to the first few career fairs just to get a 
feel of the event (regardless of whether or not you have any experience). 
Also, while making a resume, make a GitHub account and a LinkedIn 
profile, both will come in handy! Furthermore, the [Champaign 
Urbana Research Park](http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/) offers both
Summer Internships and part time work opportunities during the semester at 
top companies including Yahoo!, Capital One, Jump Labs, Nvidia and Akuna Capital. 
In regards to preparing for interviews, some of the best resources include 
CS 225: Data Structures (often considered a requirement for an interview), the 
book Cracking the Coding Interview (the most comprehensive book on taking coding interviews), 
and questions on Glassdoor. People also use sites like [leetcode.com](leetcode.com), 
[hackerrank.com](hackerrank.com) or the interview prep giving at the Engineering Career Center or by groups like ACM or WCS.
