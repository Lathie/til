In addition to the [Illinois Career Center](https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/), there is a special [Engineering Career Services](http://ecs.engineering.illinois.edu/) targeted just at engineering students. In addition to the typical services you would expect, they do a lot of work with companies to help get students hired. This takes the form of organizing career fairs and creating guidelines for companies governing things like deadlines to accept job offers. They also allow you to print out a free name badge at their office in DCL. I would highly suggest paying them a visit as you begin your search for an internship. They also provide mock interviews, resume reviews, and general career help.
