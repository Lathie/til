It is important to network and build up relationships with companies and recruiters. 
It is also important to network with your peers and alumni (LinkedIn! Company Networking Sessions! Career Fairs! RSOs!)
Many companies will look to their interns to provide lists of their friends who would make 
great interns/full-time employees at the company. The recruiters will then reach out to 
these students to interview them. This is a great way to get your foot in the door.
Other opportunities for meeting companies include the various tech talks, coffee breaks,
or general meet and greet events hosted by either the department or an RSO (keep an eye 
on your email and FB events). The best way to help yourself get on these lists is by simply 
being active in clubs and working on projects with friends. These sorts of things allow you 
to show off your ability to work well with other people as well as your technical abilities.
